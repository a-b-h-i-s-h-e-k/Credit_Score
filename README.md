## Libraries and Tools
The following libraries and tools were used in this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical computations.
- scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
- seaborn: For enhanced data visualizations.
- imbalanced-learn: For handling imbalanced datasets.
- xgboost: For building the XGBoost model.


## Environment Setup and Data Acquisition
- Install Required Libraries:
   -  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn xgboost

- Download the Dataset:
Ensure you have the dataset available for processing. The dataset should include various features related to credit score classification.

## Data Preprocessing

1. Load the Dataset:
Load the dataset using pandas and perform an initial exploration to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

2. Handle Missing Values:
Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. This may involve filling missing values with appropriate statistics or dropping rows/columns with excessive missing data.

3. Feature Engineering:

- Create new features if necessary.
- Encode categorical variables using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Scale numerical features using standardization or normalization.

4. Split the Dataset:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Model Training and Validation
1. Define the Models:
 - Train various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
 - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

## Training the Models:

- Train each model on the training dataset.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

## Evaluation Metrics
1. Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
2. Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
3. Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
4. F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5. ROC-AUC Score: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.


## Results and Analysis
 1. Compare Model Performance:

  - Compare the performance of different models using the evaluation metrics.
  - Select the best-performing model based on the metrics.
 2. Feature Importance:

  - Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.

 3. Visualize Results:

  - Create visualizations to showcase the model's performance and feature importance.

## How to Run the Project
1. Set Up Environment:
- Install the required libraries 


2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
- Open the Credit_Score_Classification.ipynb notebook and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

3. Analyze Results:
- Review the results and visualizations to understand the model's performance and insights from the data.
